This project proposes a system which adapts itself based on the traffic density in each lane to ameliorate the existing traffic regulation system which is inefficient due to its equal waiting time allotment for each lane. The traffic density calculation incorporates Object Detection and Object Tracking powered by Neural Networks. The system further can be made seamless and efficient by prioritizing lanes in which an Ambulance is detected.
